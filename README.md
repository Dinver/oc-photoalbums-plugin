# Photo Albums plugin

This is a plugin to create, edit and display photos arranged in albums. Each Photo is a separate entity and Album is a collection of photos.
Each photo can have a title, an url and can be displayed in an album or as a single photo.

Default partials markup is created in assumption that you have Bootstrap CSS in place, feel free to override.

At the moment, only basic functionality is ready. You can:
 - create and edit photo albums
 - add photos to albums
 - add descriptions to albums and photos
 - use 3 components: albums list, album (to output album photos) and photo (to output single photo)

DEVELOPMENT IS ONGOING, NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION SITES
